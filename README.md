# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (dsa-python)
This repository contains classic data structure and algorithm implementations written in Python. It demonstrates foundational CS concepts and serves as both a learning exercise and a reference for interview preparation.

## Features
- Singly Linked List  
- Stack and Queue  
- Binary Search Tree (BST)  
- Graph with BFS and DFS traversal  
- Classic Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection)

## File Structure
- linked_list.py # Singly linked list implementation
- stack_queue.py # Stack and queue classes
- binary_search_tree.py # BST with insert/search/traversal
- graph_algorithms.py # Graph representation with BFS and DFS
- sorting_algorithms.py # Bubble, Insertion, and Selection sorts

## Motivation
This project showcases core data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch without relying on Pythonâ€™s built-in abstractions. It's intended to:
- Reinforce understanding of fundamental CS concepts
- Serve as a personal study aid for interviews
- Demonstrate ability to write clean, modular Python code
